# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## This project works with data on several different campaigns both nationally and internationally in order to pull data to provide Louis information on how her play did relative to others based on when plays were launched, and what their funding goals were. 
### The purpose of this analysis is to gain insight into Louis' own play. We used the data we have on other campaigns to compare how Louis did in relation to them when comparing launch dates and funding goals. This Project is done to to show the correlation between successful, failed, and canceled plays with their funding goals and launch dates.
## Analysis and Challenges
- I performed this analysis of plays based on launch dates and funding goals through a series of steps. To analyze campaigns by launch date, I started with my Kickstarter worksheet which has all my starting data on it. I created a new column to the right and formulated the cells in this column to pull the year from the Date Cretaed Conversion Column. This allowed me to retrieve information on when each campaign was launched- by year. I then created a pivot table using all my data on the "Kickstarter" spreadsheet and moved that over to a new spreadsheet. I created my table to show outcomes in the columns (filtering out "live") and the launch dates by month in the rows. I added filters to my pivot table that would allow me to narrow down parent category and years. I used these filters to show only the parent category "theater." I was able to then create a line chart to visualize the data I gathered on the relationship between outcomes and launch months for theater campaigns.
