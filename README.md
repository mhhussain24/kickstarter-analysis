# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## This project works with data on several different campaigns both nationally and internationally in order to pull data to provide Louis information on how her play did relative to others based on when plays were launched, and what their funding goals were. 
### The purpose of this analysis is to gain insight into Louis' own play. We used the data we have on other campaigns to compare how Louis did in relation to them when comparing launch dates and funding goals. This Project is done to to show the correlation between successful, failed, and canceled plays with their funding goals and launch dates.
## Analysis and Challenges
I performed this analysis of plays based on launch dates and funding goals through a series of steps. To analyze campaigns by launch date, I started with my Kickstarter worksheet which has all my starting data on it. I created a new column to the right and formulated the cells in this column to pull the year from the Date Cretaed Conversion Column. This allowed me to retrieve information on when each campaign was launched- by year. I then created a pivot table using all my data on the "Kickstarter" spreadsheet and moved that over to a new spreadsheet. I created my table to show outcomes in the columns (filtering out "live") and the launch dates by month in the rows. I added filters to my pivot table that would allow me to narrow down parent category and years. I used these filters to show only the parent category "theater." I was able to then create a line chart to visualize the data I gathered on the relationship between outcomes and launch months for theater campaigns.
- See the first embedded image for visualization of my analysis. The chart shows the number of successful, failed, or canceled projects by month. The months are on the x axis while the outcomes for each month are shows on the y axis.

To analyze campaigns by funding goals I started by creating a new worksheet in my Kickstarter spreadsheet file. I added headers to this new worksheet that would show me the number and percentages of campaigns that were either successful, failures, or canceled based on their funding goal amounts. Under the "Goal" column is a series of ranges that each campaign could potentially fall under. However, since I only wanted to see plays, and only those plays that would fit under teh header of each column, I used the COUNTIFS formula to extract only the data I needed for my purposes. The total projects column added up all the number of successful, failed, and canceled. I was able to use the total to help me find percentages for each outcome. Using the results of this analysis I created a visual to help explain my findings. Please see the second embed image for a line chart that shows funding goal ranges on the x axis and the percentage of whether they were sucessful or failures on the y axis. 
- Please note that there are only 2 lines, since no canceled play campaigns exist.
