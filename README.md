# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## This project works with data on several different campaigns both nationally and internationally in order to pull data to provide Louis information on how her play did relative to others based on when plays were launched, and what their funding goals were. 
### The purpose of this analysis is to gain insight into Louis' own play. We used the data we have on other campaigns to compare how Louis did in relation to them when comparing launch dates and funding goals. This Project is done to to show the correlation between successful, failed, and canceled plays with their funding goals and launch dates.
